Sum Of Squares
2018 Paul H Alfille

This is a program to investigate decomposing an arbirtrary integer into the sum of integer squares
Actgiallu into the fewest number of terms

E.g. 29 = 25 + 4 = 5^2 + 2^2
or   23 = 16 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 -- 5 terms
     23 = 9 + 9 + 4 + 1      -- 4 terms
     
     
Of course we extend that to cubes, fourth powers, etc...
