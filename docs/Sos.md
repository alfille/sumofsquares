<h2 id="sum-of-squares">Sum of Squares</h2>
<p>This is a program to explore the integer math of decomposing numbers into sums of squares.</p>
<p>Actually, since 1 is a square, there is a trivial decomposition -- all 1's. Instead we want the minimum number of terms.</p>
<p>Example:<br>
7 = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 2^2^+1^2^ + 1^2^+1^2^<br>
Four terms</p>
<p>23 = 9 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 3^2^+3^2^+2^2^+1^2^<br>
Also 4 terms</p>
<p>40 = 36 + 4 = 6^2^ + 2^2^<br>
2 terms</p>
<p>In fact, is seems that 4 terms is the maximum, although that's hard to prove.<br>

A note about the X axis in these graphs -- each point is the interval between x^2^ and (x+1)^2^</p>
