Sum of Squares
#********
Mathematical exploration
How can a number be made from the sum of squares of integers?

Actually we'll explore other powers as well, like sum of cubes.

An example:
	$ ./sos2 4
			       1,       1
			       2,       1,       1
			       3,       1,       1,       1
			       4,       2
			       5,       2,       1
			       6,       2,       1,       1
			       7,       2,       1,       1,       1
			       8,       2,       2
			       9,       3
			      10,       3,       1
			      11,       3,       1,       1
			      12,       2,       2,       2
			      13,       3,       2
			      14,       3,       2,       1
			      15,       3,       2,       1,       1
			      16,       4
